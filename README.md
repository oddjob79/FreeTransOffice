Job Tracking and Invoicing App for Freelance Translators

This project was written as a first attempt at grasping OOP techniques in PHP.
It was written for 3 purposes:
  1. As a learning process for myself
  2. As a demonstration of my skills with a view of gaining employment in this area
  3. As a fully functioning tool for freelance translators to utilize
  
The app is hosted on a pre-built Bitnami LAMP stack on the Google Cloud Platform
The application is online and available for anyone who wishes to use it at https://app.freetransoffice.com. There is also a development version at https://dev.freetransoffice.com.

Comments and suggestions are welcome, but please be kind. I have flown solo on this and there are many areas I would like to clean up that I know about, as well as I'm sure many areas that I do not.

Thank you kindly,

Rob Turner
